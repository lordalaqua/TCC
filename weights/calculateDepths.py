# Rotate sphere
# Call matlab crop code


# run depth estimation
# (run depth for all images before saving (it's all python)),
# save max and min and change all images using same range conversion

# reproject depths to sphere
# rotate spheres back to same center

# find weights for each image
# # multiply images by weights

# combine weighed depths
# voila
